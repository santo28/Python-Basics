# Basics of Python for new programmers 
 
#1 Printing in Python
print("Hello, Class!")

#2 Syntax and if-statement. INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT IF NOT YOU WILL GET AN ERROR 
if 5 > 2: 
    print ('Team #6 is the BEST')


#3 Indentation has to be consistent 

if 4 > 2:
    print("Indentation is Important") 
if 3 > 2:
    print("Don't forget to use the same amount of identation in the same Code Block!") 

#4 Storing Variables 
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)   

#5 Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
x = 4       # x is of type integer
x = "Sally" # BUT NOW WE ARE SAYING THAT --> x is now of type string
print(x)
